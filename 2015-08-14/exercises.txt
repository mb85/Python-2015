Programming exercises for 2015-08-14
------------------------------------

1. Write a program to calculate the factorial of a number. Yes, you could import the factorial function from the "math" module, but don't.

2. Write a program that outputs the Fibonacci Sequence.

3. Write a program that calculates the distance between two points in 3D space (you can Google the formula).

4. Write a program which displays the first n automorphic numbers. An automorphic number is a number whose square ends in the same digit as the number itself. E.g. 25 is an automorphic number because square of 25 = 625 (so the square ends with the number 25 itself).

5. Write a program that automatically converts English text to Morse code.

6. Write a function that combines two lists by alternatingly taking elements, e.g. [a, b, c], [1, 2, 3] -> [a, 1, b, 2, c, 3].

7. Write a program that reads a text file, and outputs the top twenty most common words contained within it.

8. Write a program that reads a text file, and returns the longest word contained within it.

9. Write a program that takes a word as input, and checks whether all the letters in it are unique.

10. Write a program that accepts a series of strings entered by the user, then displays them in a frame. For example:

    *********************
    * This is some text *
    * in a frame!       *
    *********************

Use whatever character you like to separate the text into lines, such as "|".

11. Write a program that allows you to choose five (or maybe more) numbers, then simulates a lottery draw, counting how many times it would take before you won.
